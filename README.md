# Windows-XP-Battery-Icon
A small and kinda useless utility for transforming windows 11/10 PCs into Windows XP. 

It's mainly made for Laptops since they can be unplugged, as the XP Battery Icon doesn't show up IF you're plugged in.

It works best with NetAnimate/Network Indicator, 3FVX with the XP Theme, and Retrobar.

I'm soon planning to add more Battery Icons to the program to make it not as useless.
